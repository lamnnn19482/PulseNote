# PulseNote Support

Need help with PulseNote ✦ AI Summary? Choose the best option below:

## 1. Open a GitHub issue (recommended)

1. Go to the repository’s **Issues** tab.
2. Click **New issue** and pick the template that matches:
   - **Bug report** – describe steps, expected vs. actual result, include console logs if possible.
   - **Feature idea** – explain the workflow and why it helps PulseNote users.
3. Attach screenshots or the text transcript (scrub personal data first).

## 2. Share private details

If you need to share license info, billing data, or private videos, create a **Private Support Request**:

1. Draft a short message with:
   - PulseNote version (see `chrome://extensions`).
   - Browser + OS.
   - Link to the video (if sharable).
   - Exact error message or summary ID.
2. Email everything to `support@pulsenote.ai` (or your preferred inbox) and mention any linked GitHub issue for context.

## 3. Quick self-checks

- Confirm the YouTube video exposes official captions (auto-generated/hidden captions may be inaccessible).
- Make sure you still have free summaries or a valid Gumroad license token.
- Reload the page after changing transcript languages so YouTube refreshes available tracks.
- Verify that your backend endpoint (`SUMMARY_API_BASE_URL`) is reachable over HTTPS.

## Response Times

- **GitHub Issues:** first reply within 2 business days.
- **Email:** within 1 business day for billing/license problems.

You can customize these SLAs to match your actual workflow before publishing the repository.
